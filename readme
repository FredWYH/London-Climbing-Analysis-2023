This is an analytical project that explores the decision making of climbers amongst climbing walls in London.
Only 29 walls in Greater London are included in this dataset, as far east as Hayes (The Nest), west (The Reach), south (Croywall), northeast (Harrowall), and northwest (Yonder).
Individual categories of pricing are logged, including standard, concession, discounts, membership and rentals.
Comparisons are put up against factors like facilities available, and opening hours.

Dataset is manually collated from pricing published and available on the individual websites as of 28 March 2023.
